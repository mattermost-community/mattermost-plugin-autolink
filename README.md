# Autolink Plugin (Beta) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-autolink.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-autolink)

This plugin creates regular expression (regexp) patterns that are reformatted into a Markdown link before the message is saved into the database.

Use it to add custom auto-linking on your Mattermost system, such as adding links to your issue tracker based on the regexp patterns.

**Supported Mattermost Server Versions: 5.2+ for 0.3+. 5.0 and 5.1 for all versions before 0.3**

## Installation

1. Go to the [releases page of this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-autolink) and download the latest release for your Mattermost server.
2. Upload this file in the Mattermost **System Console > Plugins > Management** page to install the plugin. To learn more about how to upload a plugin, [see the documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/plugins.html#plugin-uploads).
3. Modify your `config.json` file to include the types of regexp patterns you wish to match, under the `PluginSettings`. See below for an example of what this should look like.

## Usage

Autolinks have 2 parts: a **Pattern** which is a regular expression search pattern utilizing the https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/ library, and a **Template** that gets exanded. You can create variables in the pattern with the syntax `(?P<name>...)` which will then be expanded by the corresponding template.

In the template, a variable is denoted by a substring of the form `$name` or `${name}`, where `name` is a non-empty sequence of letters, digits, and underscores. A purely numeric name like $1 refers to the submatch with the corresponding index. In the $name form, name is taken to be as long as possible: $1x is equivalent to ${1x}, not ${1}x, and, $10 is equivalent to ${10}, not ${1}0. To insert a literal $ in the output, use $$ in the template.

Below is an example of regexp patterns used for autolinking, modified in the `config.json` file:
